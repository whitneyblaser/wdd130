        WB Rings and things is a jewelry store that designs jewelry to represent our love of God. 
        Many times we wear jewelry that represents something. We wanted to represent the most important thing.

        passionately. We strive to help others feel the love of Christ! We hope that through these bracelets, necklaces, and rings and hopefully more one day we can

        showing how much they love God! We carry rings, bracelets, necklaces and hopefully one day, apparel! We love good fashionable jewelry but we also offer simple and elegant jewelry. We hope 
        that anyone and everyone can find something that they love and adore! We are asked to spread this gospel and we often think that means only physically sharing but

      <h3>Our Purpose!</h3>

        Our purpose is to help spread the love of our God. Wearing something that represents God is a good feeling and it's an even better feeling when some asks what you are wearing. When this happens you are able to spread the savior's love to more people! 
        We know that there is bound to be a series of questions that people will want to know, so we have some FAQs. 
        1) Do we carry gold, silver, and rose gold? Yes, we will carry all three colors!
        2) We can we expect our package? How long does delivery take? We can't promise but we can say that we try to work as fast and efficiently as we can and you can expect your order in 2-4 weeks!
        3) What is the jewelry made out of? Our jewelry is made from only high quality materials, such as 18k Gold and Stainless steel! 
        4) What is the durability like? Our necklaces are incredibly durabblbe, they are swear-proof, water-proof, and scratch-resistant. You'll never have to worry about green marks on your skin either! 
        We know that is going to be plenty more questions and we are very willing to anwser them! 
        We hope that you find your special peice of jewelry and share the light of our savior every day!
