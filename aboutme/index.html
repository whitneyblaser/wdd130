    <h2>Whitney Blaser</h2>
    <p>My name is Whitney Blaser and I am from Rexburg, Idaho. I grew up on a farm and that was something that I will forever be grateful for. This is my second semester here at BYUI. My major is currently undecided, 
        I am taking this class as an elective but I am interested in learning more about web design. I have recently recieved my mission call to serve in Tirana, Albania speaking Albanian. I leave May 20, 2024 and I am so excited to go.
         I loved to play sports in high school but now that I am in college I am on the hunt for some new hobbies. I love hanging out with my family and friends and consider that my favorite hobby.   </p>
